# Mica for Everyone!
Using this little utility you can enable Mica effect on titlebar of all apps.

It also supports enabling dark titlebar on all apps and can be enabled throught an option.

All window borders are rendered by Windows using DWM and this app only sets its flag using an undocumented API.

This app requires at least Windows 11 (10.0.22000.0) to work.

## TODO

[] Configure using a config file

[] Window blacklist
